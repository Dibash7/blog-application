# Project Title

Blog Application

## About

This is a simple blog application with CRUD functionality implemented using MEAN stack.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git - Download & Install Git. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - Download & Install Node.js and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this GitHub Gist to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - Download & Install MongoDB, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

### Downloading the project

There are several ways you can get this project:

#### Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get MEAN.js is to use git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:

```
https://github.com/Dibash7/blog-application.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a meanjs folder.

#### Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the master branch on GitHub.

### Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json and bower.json files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```
npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```
npm install
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the development environment configuration, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:3000
